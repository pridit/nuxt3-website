            Hello, I'm Jordan Heale&mdash;a professional full stack web app developer currently based in
            <span class="whitespace-nowrap">Greater London, England,</span> with over 5 years of
            industry experience.
            <span class="font-normal">
              I specialise in <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel</a> and have a keen
              interest in infrastructure and cloud technology.

          <Paragraph>
            In a volunteer capacity I have contributed towards the encyclopedia
            <a href="https://pcgamingwiki.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PCGamingWiki</a>&mdash;there I spent 3
            years as an administrator, and in that time built
            <a href="https://github.com/pridit/pcgw-assignments" target="_blank">PCGW Assignments</a> to manage and
            allocate press review codes for upcoming title releases.

          <Paragraph>
            Outside of the web, but within the realm of tech, I also dabble in hosting video game servers and operated a
            relatively popular

            >Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead</a> server back in 2019&mdash;creating a modular
            <a href="https://github.com/pridit/co40_Domination.Takistan" target="_blank">codebase</a> from scratch as
            part of it.

          <Paragraph>
            When I'm not messing with tech I enjoy hiking, going for a long relaxing drive, and ensuring my
            responsibility as a pet owner is up to snuff.
